			<h2> MY INTEREST, ACTIVITES </h2>

Why Kassia? Kassia was a very respected woman in mythology and the Bible because of her elegance, her talents and her commitment. I am also a very committed woman and I am in HEFORSHE, the feminist association of the ESSEC

			<h2> MODESSEC </h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					&#9790; </li>
					<li>Elected at the beginning of January as president of the fashion and luxury association of essec, I have been in office for almost 4 months. 
I am very proud and I take my responsibility to heart 
It is an association which looks like many different talents in different areas, creation, communication, treasury, events... 
I am in charge of ensuring the good coherence within the whole team. 
Modessec organises annual fashion shows with beautiful fashion houses and partnerships with numerous public figures. It offers many opportunities to students through the network it is building little by little.</li>
					<li> my biggest challenge for this mandate is to cope with covid by maintaining activity within the association and to continue to create content by adapting to the conditions. </li>
					<li>I have launched the organisation of a virtual fashion show, a partnership to make items with essec Africa using fabrics from the Congo. We are planning a pop up store on the theme of the 70's to showcase the small businesses that some students run.</li>
					<li>We work a lot on MODESEC's image on social networks by proposing interesting and instructive content on the fashion world </li> 
					<a href="https://www.instagram.com/modessec/?hl=fr" class = "btn-red" >Take a look</a>
				
					<li>I Would love to introduce you to some content that I like to watch that gives me and inspires me to set up all my Modessec projects </li>

			<h2> More about me... </h2>
			<p>
				Born in a French-Colombian family, I am trilingual; I speak fluent French, Spanish and English. <br> I am very attached to the Colombian culture and I visit my family at least twice a year. I love the culture, the food, the atmosphere, the people, the music, the dance. A big part of my happiness is there.  </br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The BBA at ESSEC allows me to grow little by little and I know that I would like to work in digital transformation and digital marketing.  <br> I am always aware of trends and I know how to use this knowledge, that's why I want to make my passion my job and one day be able to work in the fashion world. </br>
			</p>
			<p>
				if I had to define it in a few words I would say that I am enterprising, independent, persevering, and down to Earth  
				<br>I am persevering and I want to be a role model for my future children; my biggest motivation is my personal development as a woman, that is my motivation.  </br>
